Description: Device driver library for Ocean Optics spectormeters - Utility programs
 SeaBreeze is a minimalistic, multi-platform (Windows, Linux, MacOS) device
 driver for Ocean Optics spectrometers, designed specifically for embedded
 applications needing to run in resource-constrained hardware environments.
 SeaBreeze provides a fully working and tested REFERENCE IMPLEMENTATION of the
 Ocean Optics USB interface, demonstrating how Ocean Optics spectrometers can
 be commanded and controlled from C/C++. It is provided with full C/C++ source
 code so that customers can customize and extend it to support exactly those
 features and functions they require.
